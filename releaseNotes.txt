v.0.4.5 - Speed Improvements Release

Date: 28th of August 2023



What's new:

	Ctrl Rig is now two times faster than before.
	Ctrl and MetaData nodes now inherit from the MPxTransform node and do not have a shape node.
	Z is now the default up axis.



	Lunar Framework:
		
		CtrlNode:
			Renames drawFkIkState to drawSolverMode.
			Renames fkIkStatePosition to solerModePosition.

		CtrlCommand:
			Returns a single string with the transform node instead of a list with transform / shape node.




	Lunar Rig:
		All controllers are now connected via messeage attributes to the components.
		Weapon slots are locked and placed in the correct place.




Bug Fixes:
	Ctrl is updating the pole vector line properly by marking the geometry dirty.
	Ctrl is now properly evaluated in EM and has some optimizations from the MPxGeometryOverride.




What need's to be done:
	Add spine ik to the rig.
	Optimize the ik solver.
	Speed up preserveOutsideKeys bake which is around 10 times slower now.
	Clean up import animation time madness in the animation toolset method.
	Bake Ctrl to Export Skeleton for selected time range on the timeslider.
	Bake Export Skeleton to Ctrls for selected time range on the timeslider.
